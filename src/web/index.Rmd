# **Goal**
Evaluate the effectiveness of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) broadband initatives with respect to rural property values and internet speed.
<br>
The USDA would like to quantify the impact of their investments into broadband infrastructure nationally. This study aims to devise novel statistical methodology that allow for broadband program evaluation. 

# **Project Sponsor**
The sponsor of this project is the USDA Economic Research Service, and our stakeholder is John Pender, senior economist.

# **Method**
##Hedonic Regression Model 
Housing prices were modelled with a hedonic regression model. Different characteristics of each property such as square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms were evaluated for the effect on house prices so that we could isolate the effects of the program.

##Difference in Differences 
To illustrate the effects of the program on internet speeds and housing prices, we implemented difference in differences by including indicators for time elapsed, position relative to project border, and the interaction between the two.
